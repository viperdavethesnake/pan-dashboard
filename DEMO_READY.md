## Demo Script

### Opening (Show the Problem)
*"Imagine you have 25 million files across your organization. How do you find insights?"*

### Traditional Approach (Show Grafana)
1. Open Grafana: http://192.168.33.223:3000
2. Show pre-built dashboards
3. *"This is great for standard reports, but what if you have a custom question?"*

### The AI Solution (The Wow Factor)
1. Open AI Chat: http://192.168.33.223:8080
2. Select "file-query-assistant" model

### Demo Queries (In Order)

#### 1. Simple Count (Warm-up, ~15 seconds first time)
```
How many files do we have?
```
**Expected**: 25,525,845 files

#### 2. Quick Query (Show speed, <1 second)
```
What are the top 3 file types?
```
**Expected**: JPG, BLI, PDF

#### 3. Business Question (Show SQL generation)
```
Which file extension uses the most storage?
```
**Expected**: Shows SQL + JPG with 9.1 TB

#### 4. Time-based Analysis
```
How many files are older than 5 years?
```
**Expected**: Large number with SQL shown

#### 5. Complex Query (Impressive finish)
```
What is the total storage in GB for files older than 7 years?
```
**Expected**: ~17 TB with proper conversion

#### 6. Domain Analysis (If time)
```
How many unique domains own files?
```

### The Closing
*"Notice how fast that was? Every query after the first takes less than 1 second. And look at the SQL - it's accurate, optimized ClickHouse queries. No SQL knowledge required!"*
